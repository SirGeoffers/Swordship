# Swordship

## About
Swordship is a physics based arena brawler where players must collect weapons and use them to ram into and destroy their opponents.  The game was originally being developed by [Tsai Maxim](https://twitter.com/TsaiMaxim), but the project was cancelled before completion.  I was intrigued by the gameplay and decided to create my own version of the game as a development exercise.  I developed the game over the course of around 6 months, creating all of the gameplay elements from scratch.  The game includes both keyboard and Xbox controller support and can be played locally with up to 4 players.

Since I am no longer actively working on this project, I wanted to release the code for those interested.  You can find a download link for the most recent build on [my portfolio](http://sirgeoffers.github.io/pages/projects/swordship.html).
